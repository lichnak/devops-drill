# OpsEng development guides

At OpsEng we practice [inner source development](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/devops-best-practices).

That is we use best practices from open source software development and the establishment of an open source-like culture
within F13Cybertech. It helps us to:

* Create better product innovation and quality
* Unblock dependencies by just doing it yourself
* Achieve successful reuse and efficient collaboration across organizational unit boundaries

We want to make it as easy as possible for developers from various teams to become OpsEng contributors, so weâ€™ve created
this guide to help you get started.
